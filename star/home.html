                <p align="left">Sudeep began his film career in Thayavva (1997). He then played a supporting role in Prathyartha, directed by Sunil Kumar Desai, and a lead role in the same director's Sparsha. In 2001, a role in Huchcha gave him his first big following. In 2008 he made his Bollywood debut in Phoonk.[citation needed] He has also starred in Ram Gopal Varma's movies Rann, Phoonk 2 and Rakta Charitra. They were followed by Kempe Gowda and Vishnuvardhana (2011).</p>
