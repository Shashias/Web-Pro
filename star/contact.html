                <p align="left">Yash was born on 8 January 1986 in Boovanahalli, a village in Hassan, Karnataka.[1][2] He was given two names: Naveen legally, and his mother's side of the family named him Yashwanth.[3][a] Yashwanth was chosen since they believed his time of birth astrologically necessitated a name beginning with the letter à²¯ (ya).[5] In keeping with a Hindu tradition of giving a child a deity's epithet, Yash was described as Nanjundeshwara ("poison-drinker god", referring to Shiva).[5][6] Before starting his acting career, he was advised by others in the industry to adopt a stage name.[7] Desiring to stand out with a name that was unique for an actor in Karnataka, he shortened Yashwanth to Yash.[8]</p>
